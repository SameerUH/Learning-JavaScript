So far I've been learning the basics using HubSpots guide and I'm getting the hang of it, I can see similarities and differences between JavaScript and Python/C/C++ so I'm using that to help learn and also experiment with code.

I think I'm going to learn through a certification so that I can pace myself and so that I have a bunch of resources I can look through and read to learn.

The CISCO Learning Academy looks pretty interesting so I'm tempted to enrol for that, my main worry is that I won't upload consistently on Github but I'll definetely try my best.
