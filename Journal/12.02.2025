Still going through the course and learn't about variables, the types you can have and how to declare/initialize them.

Haven't thought about a good way to show my progress of code on github and not only show a couple of lines. So I've decided to just comment out my old progress and have the latest version at the very bottom.

May take a while to finish this off given that I'm also taking notes and coding but need to remember that I'm learning the basics of JavaScript so I won't be going into any large projects yet.
