Finished learning about variables and the section quiz from the course, will do the section lab tomorrow and hopefully get it finished by then.

Took a break yesterday which is why I didn't upload a git but might be doing less gits weekly so I can focus on more important stuff career wise, overall I do think I'm making great progress on learning JavaScript and it'll be good for me career wise as well.
